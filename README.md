# Progress Report 2009

During my PhD at the [Institute of Anatomy](http://ana.unibe.ch) of the [University of Bern](http://unibe.ch) I was running a SVN repository server on the [virtual server infrastructure](http://www.id.unibe.ch/content/services/hosting/virtuelle_server/) of the University of Bern.

Since I'm no longer working there I migrated all the code to GitHub, using `git svn clone http://code.ana.unibe.ch/svn/RepositoryName`

I was part of the [PhD Programme in Cellular and Biomedical Sciences](http://www.gcb.unibe.ch/) and had to submit a progress report every year.
This repository is the progress report from 2009, minus the bibliography, since that has since then been migrated to [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/profiles/david-haberthur/).
